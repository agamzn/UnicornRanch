# Unicorn Ranch

Welcome to the Unicorn Ranch series of python labs. I'm putting these together to help you (whomever you are) grow your python skills. The primary audience here are AWS Solutions Architects who may not have much python experience. This is a living/breathing lab, and it may not provide equal value for everyone - especially those who have a python background in production environments.


# Labs
Note: Labs are evaluated programtically. 

Lab 1 Deliverables:

Write a function in the existing class. This function will take no input parameters. The function will return a dictionary that contains the following data: the estimated property tax bill for the year; the estimated property tax bill with 1.2% appreciation/yr over the next 5 years; the tax rate (percentage) based on a value of 1.2 Million

Please submit your work as a Pull Request to this repo. Your destination branch should be your first/last initials.
